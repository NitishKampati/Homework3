            <p>Welcome to my blog! This is my first post, where I'll be sharing my thoughts and experiences as a web developer and also some of my favourites.Excerpt from One of my favorite game,  I love playing Cricket Cricket is a beloved pastime for millions around the world. It's a game that 	combines skill, strategy, and athleticism. For many, cricket is more than just a sport - it's a way of life. The rhythmic sound of 	willow striking leather, the roar of the crowds, and the camaraderie among teammates make cricket a truly captivating experience. </h2></p>
